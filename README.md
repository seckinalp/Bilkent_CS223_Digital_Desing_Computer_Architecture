# Bilkent_CS223_Digital_Desing_Computer_Architecture
My solutions to Bilkent University Digital Design Course which focuses on SystemVerilog and computer architecture.

## Topics:

`Lab1 "Introduction to Digital Logic Circuits"`: Focuses on understanding and building basic digital circuits using transistors and logic gates, emphasizing schematic drawing and circuit implementation.

`Lab2 "FPGA-Based Circuit Design"`: Advances into implementing digital logic circuits on an FPGA, requiring  Xilinxâ€™s design tools and SystemVerilog for circuit modeling and simulation.

`Lab3 "Modeling Decoders and MUXs in SystemVerilog"`: Focuses on developing and simulating decoder and multiplexer circuits using structural and behavioral SystemVerilog, preparing students for FPGA implementation.

`Lab4 "Designing and Implementing a Traffic Light System"`: Focuses on developing a traffic light control system using SystemVerilog, emphasizing state machine design, simulation, and FPGA implementation to manage intersection safety and efficiency.

`Lab5 "Designing an 8-Bit Serial Adder"`: Focuses on constructing an unsigned 8-bit serial adder using shift registers and a full adder in SystemVerilog, culminating in FPGA implementation and control via pushbuttons and switches.

`Project`: For our CS223 project, we're tasked with creating a simple programmable processor using SystemVerilog. This project is about digital system design, including designing both the datapath and controller of a processor. We need to ensure it supports basic instructions like Load, Store, Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, and Display. It's a challenging yet exciting project that requires a solid understanding of processor architecture and SystemVerilog programming.
